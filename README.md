# xxGA
Genetic Algorithm implementation.

It is a GA implementation to minimize functions.

Makefile automatically created by Eclipse.

## Compile

```bash
cd Default
make
```

## Run
After compile.

```bash
Default/GA
```

First the program ask for the number of vars of the function to minimize. Then it request for the function. This http://warp.povusers.org/FunctionParser/ library was used for that. Last you need to provide the range for all the vars and the num of bits used to encode that variables.
 
## Configuration
etc/config

A place to configure the algorithm. No all the options are aviable yet.
